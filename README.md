## 1. Dog_breed Identifier using *TransferLearning*
  * Dataset involved is from `kaggle` - https://www.kaggle.com/c/dog-breed-identification/data
  * We're dealing with images (unstructured data) so it's probably best we use deep learning or transfer learning.
  * There are 120 breeds of dogs i.e 120 different classes.
  * The model used is [mobilenet_v2](https://tfhub.dev/google/imagenet/mobilenet_v2_130_224/classification/4) from `TensorFlow Hub`.
